## Abstract

The objective of this paper is to investigate the approach of using adaptive difficulty
in Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG) to help create an
optimal game experience for the player. By analyzing how a boss fight works in
an MMORPG, measurable parameters are identified to determine whether difficulty
adjustments would enhance the playerâ€™s game experience. Furthermore, elements of the
system are established which can be regulated in order to apply difficulty adjustments.
These findings are in turn implemented in a small scale project to simulate a boss fight
with difficulty adjustments and evaluated afterwards.
The results propose that small dynamic appropriate changes to the difficulty can
effectively improve the experience of the game. However, accurately determining
when and how to change the difficulty is a complex endeavor especially in MMORPGs.
An adaptive difficulty system can prove useful for a better game experience in an
MMORPG but has to be properly balanced with other factors like community.
